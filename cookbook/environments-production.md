## PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT

**Q:  Help!  Something broke in production!**  
Did you check it with ``--debug``?  There is a minification library that will parse your CSS and Javascript.  Check that it hasn't mangled your application by running your app with --debug.

**Q:  How do I deploy to Heroku?**  
Sadly, just don't.  Prior to 0.6.0, lots of people were using the Oortcloud Heroku Buildpack with much success.  As of 0.6.0, it seems to have broken, however.  And it's a moot point, because Heroku doesn't support Sticky Sessions, and won't scale up or support fail-over configurations.  Instead, use Meteor.com, CloudBees, or Modulus.io.

**Q:  Are there any cloud hosting providers that provide unit testing?**  
CloudBees provides a Meteor clickstart, software-as-a-service, unit testing, and continuous integration.  It's a bit klunky, but if you're worried about continuous integration, it's the one to choose:

**Q:  How do I specify an external database using MONGO_URL?**  
Okay, so you're starting to talk about separating your application layer from your database layer, and getting things ready for scale-out.  If you're looking for something quick and simple, try Modulus.io:

https://github.com/onmodulus/demeteorizer  

````
sudo npm install -g demeteorizer
sudo cd ~/path/myapp

sudo demeteorizer -n 0.8.11
sudo cd .demeteorized
sudo modulus login
sudo modulus deploy
````

**Q:  What environment variables are supported?**  
So far, the following variables have been seen in the wild:  

PORT  
MONGO_URL  
ROOT_URL  
OPLOG_URL  
METEOR_SETTINGS  
NODE_OPTIONS  
DISABLE_WEBSOCKETS  
MAIL_URL  
DDP_DEFAULT_CONNECTION_URL  
HTTP_PROXY  
HTTPS_PROXY  


------------------------------------------------------------------
**Q:  Is there any documentation on the Meteor.settings?**    
So far, the following setting parameters have been seen in the wild:  

````
Meteor.settings.privateKey == "MY_KEY"  
Meteor.settings.public.publicKey == "MY_PUBLIC_KEY"   
Meteor.settings.public.anotherPublicKey == "MORE_KEY"  
````


**Q:  What's the best practice for using content distribution networks (CDN)?**  
Currently, there's not anything specific, other than putting static content on your CDN, and creating links to it from your app.  You may want to run the meteor bundle command, and take a peek in the resulting tar.gz file.
````
meteor bundle
````
