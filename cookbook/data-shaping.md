## Data Shaping   
### A Guide to User Interface Design for Managers and C-Suite Executives  
This page is a little different than some of the other pages in the Meteor Cookbook, as it is intended more for the UI designer or business executive.  Eventually, I hope to make it into an infographic poster.   

 
### Set Theory  
There's an old saying that computers only understand three numbers:  0, 1, and many.  This saying comes from the branch of mathematics known as set theory, which concerns itself with collections of objects, and is a colloquial way of describing empty sets, regular sets, and unbounded sets.  

Suffice it to say that, in set theory, the hop from 0 to 1 is a fundamental event.  There's an existential event that occurs when going from nothing to something.  It's creative.  It's existential.  It's generative.  Once you get to 1, a person can build up all the other integers by repeating 1 a whole bunch of times.  But getting to Infinity... that requires another special type of hop, that is as unique as going from 0 to 1.  The hop from 1 to Infinity is also existential.  But in a more metaphyiscal sense. 

The existential hops from 0 to 1, and from 1 to Infinity, are often commonly taught as ``n+1 proofs`` in Calculus.    

### Real Life Applications  

So, how does this play out in the real world?  What does this teach us about designing applications?  What should the take-away be for business executives?  

This:  we always implement a feature for a single person, then apply it to the crowd.  The process of implementing features from from the 0 to the 1 to the many.  

So, if you want to create a multiuser application, first you have to implement it for a single person; then go multiuser.  If you want to create a map that displays all the zipcodes in the US; first you have to read in the first zipcode.  And so forth.
