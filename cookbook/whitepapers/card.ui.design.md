## Card User Interface Design

As far as UI goes, we choose a Card UI, as its a natural design metaphor for a document-oriented database such as Mongo, and which is suitable for denormalized healthcare data.  There are many approaches to Card UI, and we take an accessibility and ergonomics approach, which specifies a standard design convention across devices.
