      This is a sample application written in Meteor, which demonstrates the ActiveRecord pattern.  ActiveRecord is sometimes also refered to as CRUD or CRUDL, and stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, and optionally List.  It's a basic unit of database design.  So this application demonstrates building a database of animals... in this, case, horses.

    <h2>Why Horses?  Why not Cats?  Or Turtles?</h2>

      Funny story that.  The short version is that my grandfather (who I never met) was a jockey at Churchill Downs, and my great-grandfather owned horses, one of which was a foal of Omar Khayyamn, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1917.  I've recently taken an interest in the Derby, inspired by the following bit of family history.
