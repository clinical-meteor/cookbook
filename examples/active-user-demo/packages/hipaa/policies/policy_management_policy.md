# Policy Management Policy

Catalyze implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all Catalyze workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of polices are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.

## Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and up to date to maintain Catalyze compliance with HIPAA, HITRUST, NIST, and other relevant standards. Updates and version control is done similar to source code control.
2. Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by both the Security and Privacy Officer to assure accurate and up-to-date.
3. Edits and updates made by appropriate and authorized workforce members are done on their own versions, or branches. These changes are only merged back into final, or master, versions by the Privacy or Security Officer, similarly to a pull request. All changes are linked to workforce personnel who made them and the Officer who accepted them.
4. All policies are made accessible to all Catalyze workforce members. The current master policies are published [here](https://catalyze.io/policy/).
