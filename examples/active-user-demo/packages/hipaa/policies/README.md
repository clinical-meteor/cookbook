# Catalyze HIPAA Compliance Policies

HIPAA compliance is complicated, but it doesn't have to be. Catalyze helps relieve the technical burden with our HIPAA-compliant cloud computing platform and solutions for healthcare.

In an effort to make compliance as easy as possible for companies working with protected health information (PHI), we decided to open source our company policies. 
	
Our policies have been written with modern, cloud-based technology vendors in mind. We looked far and wide for policy examples that fit our company, and couldn't find any. So we wrote our own. Importantly, these policies have been through three external audits—two HIPAA audits and one HITRUST audit.

Do you handle PHI and not yet have your own company policies in place? Then you'll find our content useful.

## Why did we open source these policies?

HIPAA compliance really has two halves. The first half includes all technical guidelines, both physical and digital. Compliant companies take measures to secure their hardware and manage their software in a certain way. Encryption, logging, monitoring—these are just a few examples of HIPAA technical requirements. Catalyze builds its platform with these guidelines in mind.

The second half of HIPAA is focused on administrative and organizational activities. This includes signing Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), and managing company policies like training, among other things. Crafting company policies that align with HIPAA administrative guidelines are straightforward, but an immense burden.

When we were creating our policies, we found lots of policy templates for healthcare providers, but nothing for modern health technology companies. We spent a lot of time and effort writing our policies, then adapting them to meet the demands of external audits. We don't want people to reinvent the wheel; trust us, it's not fun. We also feel a broader community can improve these polices over time, making them better for everybody.

By open sourcing our own company policies, we hope other companies who handle PHI will benefit. It aligns with our company mission: to help you focus on building innovative healthcare applications.

## What do I do with these policies?

As a company who handles PHI, it's critical you maintain and publish your own policies. To make use of our policies, we recommend the following steps.

1. Read through all the enclosed policies to get an understanding to the structure.
2. When ready, download the policies and comb through for mentions of Catalyze or our business and change to appropriate references to your company.
3. Publish your policies in a publicly available location. The files are markdown, so you may need to convert to HTML if you don't have a publishing platform capable of markdown format. You can either create an index page linking to each individual policy, or create a single page listing all the policies in line, [much like we did](https://catalyze.io/policy/).

## Who is behind this?

[Catalyze.io](htts://catalyze.io), healthcare's trusted HIPAA-compliant platform.

We help companies who handle PHI, both business associates and covered entities, maintain compliance with our Platform as a Service, Mobile Backend as a Service, and managed data integration services. Think Heroku and Parse for healthcare. In addition, we also provide HL7 Integration for those who need to communicate with EHR vendors like Epic or Cerner.
